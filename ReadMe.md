Hi,

If you attended my talk on TDD in JavaScript at DevNexus, thank you and thanks for downloading the slide and demos from my talk on TDD in JavaScript at DevNexus.

Before you run the demos, you'll need to go into each directory and install the NPM packages. Form there you can use one of the following commands to run the tests:

Jest
* jest
* npm test

NG
* jest
* ng test

If you have any questions for follow up, you can email me at James@JamesCBender.com or follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jamesbender)
